This is a learning project that consists of three projects and is led by three amazing developers

- **Web Api:** Back-end
- **Blazor:** Site management

## How to contribute
1. Join the congodevs team if you haven't. You can use the command: `c!github jt congodevs yourGithubUsername` if you are already part of the Code2Gether org, otherwise reach out to an admin/project moderator
2. Pick an issue from the issues list or create one. You are allowed to pick any issue you would like to work on because after all this is a fun learning project. 
3. Create a branch off the dev(development) branch, master is only for stable releases
4. Name the new branch depending on what the issue is about, for example:
   - **bug fix:** fix/issueNumber-title 
   - **feature:** feature/issueNumber-title
5. When submitting a Pull request make sure that you are merging in to the dev branch, remember to use closing keywords in the description aswell so that any related issue closes. Just type `fixes #issueNumber` or `closes #issueNumber`

## Workflow
- We have a flexible agile approach, the point is that during an interview you will be able to say that you have some experience with agile and you should be able to discuss around it
- Each week we have a short check-in meeting to see what is currently being worked on and what the focus should be around next. Day and time is decided on the discord. if you cannot join the meeting make sure that you write a comment that says that you are working on your issue and what the current status is so we know that you have not gone inactive. It is also a good time to mention if there is something you need help with. The goal of each sprint is one month because as mentioned this is a fun learning project and we understand that people have other priorities.
- We make use of user stories that are then splitted up in to smaller tasks. A user story is basically: `as a certain type of person i want a certain thing to do this so i can perform some action`
